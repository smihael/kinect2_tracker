# kinect2_tracker

A fork of https://github.com/mcgi5sr2/kinect2_tracker (ROS wrapper for Kinect One using libfreenect2) with experimental support for joint orientations.


## install 

- [install libfreenect2](https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect2/)
  - Make sure to install all the optional stuff, including OpenCL and **OpenNI2**
  - When you build the library, do not follow the instructions there, instead run
  ```bash
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/
  make
  sudo make install
  ```
- [Download NiTE2](http://openni.ru/files/nite/index.html) and put it in `~/package_ws/NiTE-Linux-x64-2.2/`
  - Or you can put it in some other random places, but you need to modify `CMakeList.txt` and `setup_nite.bash`
- `source setup_nite.bash`

To run the program the launch file needs to be used

## Run

```bash
roslaunch kinect2_tracker tracker.launch
```
